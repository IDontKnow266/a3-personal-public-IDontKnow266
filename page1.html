                <p>One of the top four common maintenance is engine and cabin air filters. It is also a relatively easy
                    one
                    to do at home, but be careful!</p>

                            showcase which way to place them and from personal experience I have seen many upside down
                            filters, this can cause suffocation, for cabin it can make the blower motors work harder,
                            causing increased wear and for engine it can cause lack of air, which messes up many things
                        </td>
