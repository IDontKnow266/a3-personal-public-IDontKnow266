                        <td>Helps to pay attention to detail, you know what tires you're putting on and all that good
                            stuff</td>
                        <td>Harder job to do as more pieces can go wrong, it is also important to pay attention to how
                            you put the lug nuts on</td>
                        <td>I was working on a 2010 Lexus LS600HL, beautiful car but those tires were 275/30/R20, which
                            is big and they were super heavy, I struggled to lift them</td>

                        <td>Good to check the surroundings around the tire, brakes, wheels, and suspenison components
                        </td>
                        <td>Pay attention to the tires direction if they are directional, good to rotate as well, many
                            people mess up directional tires</td>
                        <td>For example you can read some information from 275/30/R20, 275mm tire width, 30mm sidewall,
                            and 20 inches wheels</td>

                        <td>Physically intense job compared to others, some cars have heavy tires and wheels</td>
                        <td>Tires are important, in fact one of, if not the most important piece on a car, don't cheap
                            out on them and pay attention to their tread depth</td>
