                <h2>Transcript</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Zeshan Ghumman and I am a second-year Bachelor of Computer Information Systems
                    student at Mount Royal University. I was born in Toronto, Canada, and my parents are from Pakistan.
                    I have lived in Calgary for over 9 years.
                    For my final project for COMP 2511, or Web 1, I would like to create a website that informs people
                    about the four most common or popular at-home repairs one might do on their car. I will list the
                    good, the bad and a couple fun facts for each repair. I will also include a contact form if anyone
                    has any questions for me.
                    For a bit of background, cars have always been my passion and I truly love them. I like driving,
                    working on them, cleaning, and just being surrounded by them. Before coming to Mount Royal
                    University, I was about to go apply at SAIT to become an automotive technician however, I figured I
                    would try something different.
                    Thanks for listening to my introduction, hope you enjoy the website!
                </p>
